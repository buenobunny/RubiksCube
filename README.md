# RubiksCube

This program was made for the 2019 SkillsUSA Computer Programming Competition. I would say it's pretty well documentated, as that was one of the scoring guidelines. The prompt was to graphically create a Rubik's Cube and create an auto-solver function in 8 hours straight. The classes are pretty self explanatory. The solver has some really convoluted code, but it was followed a guide provided by the judges. Otherwise, I would've tried to implement an AI.

Note: I have not kept up the project or done anything since the day of the competition in April 2019. This is the original code, in all its flaws.
